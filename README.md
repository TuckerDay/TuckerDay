Hello, I'm Tucker Day! I recently graduated from University of Montana with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have experience with data analysis and visualization.

I spend my time coding, working on community aid projects addressing food justice, training as a powerlifter, and playing drums with my band.
